            As the title says this is my first assignment that i have done in this term. It was quite easy and fun at the same time.
            I tested new stuff, such as doing an interactive website using JS/CSS, but i couldn't really do it correct, so i aborted the plan and went with
            what it was required for me to do :(.
            <h2>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h2>
            I didn't face any challenges because i already learned how to use HTML/CSS before the term begins like a week beforehand.
            <h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>
            i already know how to use HTML and CSS (i would say i know the basics of CSS)
            <h2>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>
            I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and the beginning of JS from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Udemy</a> </p>
