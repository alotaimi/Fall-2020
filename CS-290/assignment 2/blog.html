        <p>
            When i learned css a couple of weeks ago, i thought that there isn't much to do with it except a couple of things, such as coloring and changing fonts.
            However, it turns out it is much more than just these things, It turned out that it what give the page that lively looks.
        </p>
        <p>So, let's talk about the assignmnet, the assignment took me first around 3-5 hours to do, however, when i finished the first time there was
        couple of bugs, such as width of the content an stuff, that took a lot of time to fix it.</p>
        <p>However, some bugs i couldn't figure out what to do about it. So, i thought about "Why don't i start again but before doing the actual site, why don't i start drawing with my ipad the concept of the site."
            And guess what? I started drawing and making the concept of the site, and guess what happened next? After i finished drawing, i started coding everything and finished within 25-40mins, which is a huge improvement unlike the first try, and there wasn't any bugs in my code.
        </p> 
        <p class="FourthP">And if you are wondering what is my concept of the site, here it is:</p>

            <h2>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h2>
            <p>I faced some challenges, such as posts were not even, and there was a couple of dimension problems. What i did to fix them was redoing everything and drawing a concept to the website.</p>
            <h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>
           <p>before doing the actual site, draw a concept picture of the site to know what are the sizes that you wanted, and where you want your stuff at.</p>
            <h2>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>
            <p>The only thing that helped me doing this assignment was drawing a clear picture of the site, and googling some stuff.</p>
