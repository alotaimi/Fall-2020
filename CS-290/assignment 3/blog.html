            <h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
            <p>My main problem was the time because after i finished my two midterms i became exhausted because i had to study for at least 2 weeks for them and they all were in the same day, so it was kinda tough.</p>
            <h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
           <p>i didn't know anything about JavaScript actually i was scared that it would be hard, but it turns out hard but like confusingly hard because i had to watch all the previous lectures that i have missed becuase of the midterms, and then on friday 13th of November, i had to start and i was just writing codes until things started to click, and i started to learn things, which made everything easier afterwards</p>
            <h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
            <p>As i said before, Lectures helped me alot because i had to understand everything. And also, websites such as "w3schools" and many others that had a big impact on my understanding of JavaScript </p>
